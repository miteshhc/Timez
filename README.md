## Description:

**timez** is a simple utility that measures the execution time and resource usage of
commands. It is designed to be a very lightweight and minimal solution for
measuring the performance and resource usage of commands.


## Features:

- Measure execution time and resource usage of commands.
- Option to specify a fixed duration for command execution.
- Ability to save results to a file.
- Verbosity mode for detailed output.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Easy-to-read output
- Lightweight


## Installation:

### For compiling from source:

- Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/miteshhc/timez.git
```

- Compile the code:

```
cd timez && g++ args.cpp main.cpp timez.cpp utils.cpp -o timez
```

- Run the executable:

### Now, the only option is to compile from source, as the version in release is
### not up-to-date.
